opengl-graphics-common
======================

This library provides an abstraction around OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW in the hopes of making the creation of graphics applications simpler. This is mostly a personal library for use during the computer graphics class that I am currently taking, but if you think it may be useful, feel free to use it as you wish.

There is not very much documentation that goes along with it at the time of this writing but I'll hopefully add internal and external documentation at some point in the future.
